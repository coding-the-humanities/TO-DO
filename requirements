Requirements for Final Project CTH
The project should be a reflection of everything you learned by doing the Unacademic objectives. 
This means in the final project we expect that you have used:
- Polymer library
- Web Components
- JavaScript
- CSS (make it look all snazzy)
- The Rijksmuseum API
- The city of Amsterdam
- A user case study

User Case Study
In order to know 1) what you had in mind for the project and 2) what you try to communicate is also what the user getâ€™s out of your piece, do some user studies.  

User case study is intended to make the students reflect on their own work through the eyes of the user.
This goes beyond the technical achievements. Creativity and overall design of the application 
are important, as well as the choices that led to these decisions. The student must be able to substantiate their decisions.

The case study must contain an introduction explaining what they tried to achieve, why they chose their solution etc. 
The study can be a qualitative user study and they must make a case for their choices, questions and testing.
