Requirements for Final Project CTH
The project should be a reflection of everything you learned by doing the Unacademic objectives. 
This means in the final project we expect that you have used:
- Polymer library
- Web Components
- Javascript
- CSS (make it look all snazzy)
- The Rijksmuseum API
- The city of Amsterdam
- A user case study
- Correct MLA referencing

User Case Study
In order to know that what you had in mind for the project and what you try to communicate 
is also what the user getâ€™s out of your piece, do some user studies.
