#  Requirements Final Presentation CTH

The presentation should be a reflection of everything you learned by doing the Unacademic objectives. 
This means in the final project that you present, we expect that you have used:

- Polymer
- Web Components
- JavaScript
- CSS
- The Rijksmuseum API
- The city of Amsterdam
- A user case study

The presentation approach the project from two angles:

1. Design and vision (Sandberg Students)
2. Technical implementation (CtH Students)

The aim for this project for the CtH Students is explicitly not a completely working product, but a
prototype that illustrates how (a feature of) such an application should / could be implemented in code.
